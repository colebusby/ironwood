        Resident is defined as a home owner and includes everyone in the home owner's household. Children under 13 years old must be accompanied by an adult resident. People 14 to 18 years old are considered residents but may not sponsor guests. Anyone 18 years and older and residing in our community is considered an adult and may accompany children and guests.

        As we now have a salt ionizer that makes chlorine it is recommended and requested that residents do not launder swim suits after every swim as the phosphates interfere with the ionization process.
